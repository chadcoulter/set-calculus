# Canonical Terminology Ledger

## Purpose

This ledger is the canonical naming reference for the current Set Calculus architecture.

It does not create a new architectural layer. It records the stable architecture and provides one canonical definition per term, together with its structural role, allowed aliases, and provenance.

If a terminology edit would add, remove, reorder, subordinate, or redefine structural branches, stop and clarify before changing the architecture.

## Stability Rule

~~~text
architecture = stable unless explicitly changed
~~~

Terminology may be refined within the existing structure.

## Alias Rules

An alias may improve readability but must not silently change structural role.

~~~text
alias
!-> new definition
~~~

Role-qualified names are permitted when one canonical term legitimately operates through more than one interface.

~~~text
Paradox
  -> Logical Paradox
  -> Foundational Paradox

Data
  -> Data as logical structure
  -> Data as application
~~~

These are role qualifications of one canonical term, not unrelated definitions.

## Cross-Interface Rule

A term may legitimately appear in more than one structural role.

~~~text
same canonical term
+ different interface role
!= duplicate concept
~~~

Classification should answer:

~~~text
What role is this term playing here?
~~~

rather than forcing every term into exactly one disciplinary box.

## Structural Change Guard

Before changing this ledger in a way that would alter the architecture:

~~~text
proposed terminology change
        ↓
would structural relationships change?
        ↓
YES -> clarify before editing
NO  -> terminology update may proceed
~~~

This guard exists to prevent terminology maintenance from accidentally rewriting the architecture.
