# Core 0.1 Canonical Path Index

## Purpose

This file is the repository navigation index for Core 0.1.

It records where a reviewer or independent implementer should look for the current Core specification, release gate, consistency evidence, conformance work, conventional-calculus compatibility work, dependency material, and provenance model.

This index does not mark any release gate as passed. `CORE_0.1_COMPLETENESS_CHECKLIST.md` remains the canonical pass/fail authority.

## Status vocabulary

- `PRESENT` — the referenced repository path exists at this revision.
- `MISSING_REQUIRED` — the Core 0.1 checklist requires the artifact, but the referenced path does not yet exist.

A missing required artifact remains missing. The index must not substitute a nearby document or infer completion.

## Reading order

For Core 0.1 review:

1. Read `CORE_0.1_COMPLETENESS_CHECKLIST.md` for required gates, ownership, evidence, and current blockers.
2. Read `docs/philosophy-of-set-calculus/CANONICAL_TERMINOLOGY_LEDGER.md` for canonical naming.
3. Read `docs/set-calculus-core/README.md` for the Core map.
4. Read `docs/set-calculus-core/TRAJECTORY_ADMISSIBILITY_AND_RESOLUTION_DEPTH.md` for the active trajectory, witness, resolution-state, closure-predicate, and tie-break formalization.
5. Read `docs/set-calculus-core/RESOLUTION_CLOSURE_AND_REOPENING.md` for terminal closure, reopening, protected residual conservation, and provenance-preserving reclosure.
6. Read `docs/audits/CORE_0.1_G1_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT.md` for the current legacy-consistency evidence.
7. Read `PROVENANCE.md`, `docs/provenance/README.md`, and `docs/provenance/SOURCE_REFERENCES.md` before making provenance claims or edits.
8. Use `docs/conventional-calculus/README.md` and the dependency graph for the compatibility/curriculum track.
9. Treat every `MISSING_REQUIRED` row as open release work, not as an implied or partially satisfied artifact.

## Integrity rule

The path-index verifier checks that:

- every `PRESENT` path exists;
- every `MISSING_REQUIRED` path is still absent, forcing the index to be updated when the artifact appears;
- required G2 navigation categories remain represented;
- `README.md`, `SCOPE.md`, and `docs/set-calculus-core/README.md` link back to this index.

Run:

```bash
python scripts/audit_core_g2_path_index.py
```

The verifier establishes path-index consistency only. It does not establish G2 PASS or any child release gate.
